# Description
This project was made to showcase a search functionality that filters and displays results to a user in real time. It uses a hard coded array of color objects with a name and hex code and, based on a user search query, filters the data and displays the matching results to the user.

### What I would change
After finishing, I do wish I used SCSS instead of regular CSS for the nesting feature. I would also change the search functionality to also filter based on matching hex codes.
